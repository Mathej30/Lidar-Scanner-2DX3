# Lidar-Scanner-2DX3
**Project Description**
> The project aimed to create a device that measures distances in a 360-degree range vertically (up and down) using a time-of-flight sensor. This device will also collect fixed distance measurements horizontally (side to side) to create a map of the surrounding area. The collected data will be stored in the device, and you can later transfer it to a computer or web app for visualization and analysis.
